ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ria!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science and data analysis projects. I enjoy creating automation scripts. I have created a couple scripts to reduce manual tasks using Python. 
I started my career as an ETL developer and having worked for 4+ years with retail and insurance business domain I decided to pursue my Masters in Big Data. 
During my Masters, I realized that I really liked statistics and so now I use every opportunity to learn something new in it. After graduating, I have worked as a Data scientist in real estate business. During this time, I have worked on a major project to develop a new predictive model as well as developed a few dashboards showing useful metrics for business decisions.
