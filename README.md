ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ria!

ðŸ‘€ I'm a data science enthusiast with a passion for automating tasks and diving into data analysis. With a background as an ETL developer in the retail and insurance sectors for over 4 years, I decided to pursue a Masters in Big Data. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in statistics, which I continue to explore and learn about.

After completing my Masters, I transitioned into the role of a Data Scientist in the real estate industry. Notably, I led a significant project focused on building a predictive model and created informative dashboards to facilitate business decision-making. I have continued working as a data analyst in the real estate domain and acquainted myself on advanced data modelling and visualization on the way.

I thrive on new challenges and constantly seek opportunities to expand my expertise in data science. If you have any exciting projects related to data analysis, automation, or statistical applications, I'm eager to collaborate and contribute.
